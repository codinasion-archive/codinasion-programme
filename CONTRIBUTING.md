### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you want to add or modify Codinasion content, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/codinasion/codinasion-programme/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue template](https://github.com/codinasion/codinasion-programme/issues/new/choose).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/search?q=is:open+user:codinasion&type=Issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](https://github.com/codinasion/codinasion/blob/master/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes in the UI

Click **Edit in GitHub** at the top of any Codinasion webpage to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review.

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.

2. Clone the forked repository.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/your_username/codinasion-programme
  ```

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

  ```
  git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
  ```

#### Add Content

- Add or modify programme file (.py, .c, .cpp, etc) in corresponding folder.

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to [self-review](https://github.com/codinasion/codinasion/blob/master/contributing/self-review.md) to speed up the review process :zap:

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
  Once you submit your PR, a Codinasion team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
